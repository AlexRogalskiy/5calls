In 2004, the NRA successfully pressured the Republican-controlled government into not renewing the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The ban had worked to protect lives: after it expired the number of gun massacre deaths (which had decreased over 40% during the ban) jumped nearly 2.5 fold. 

Gun violence experts are now renewing their calls for a nationwide ban on these types of weapons - and Americans agree - recent polls show at least 60% of Americans support a nationwide assault weapons ban. In response, Senator Dianne Feinstein has introduced legislation to ban assault weapons (S.66). This bill would ban future sales of high-capacity magazines and military-style assault weapons, including the AR-15 which has been the weapon of choice in many recent gun massacres, such as Parkland, Las Vegas, and Newtown. 

Legislators must act now before any more lives are needlessly lost.

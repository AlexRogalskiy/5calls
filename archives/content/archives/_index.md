## 🏛 Topic Archive for 116th Congress (2019-2020)

> Topics listed here are no longer the most effective use of calls to your representatives in Congress. They may have passed or been voted down, or may be stuck waiting on a vote. If a topic looks like it'll become relevant again and get another chance at a vote, we'll bring it back to the list of active topics. Got a tip on one of these topics coming back up for a vote?
